**Research Goal:** This repository is to train a Support vector machines (SVM) model that can determine if the text input is generated by a human or a machine based on the given data from two domains (`domain1_train.json` and `domain2_train.json`). The final output of `file name` is 1k prediction samples for Kaggle competition.

To run the pipeline, please visit the `notebook` directory and run the files in order:
1. `visualize.ipynb`: This notebook is for EDA and preliminary visualization.
2. `Final_modek.ipynb`: The entire process for implementing SVM model.
