**Research Goal:** This repository is to train machine models that can determine if the text input is generated by a human or a machine based on the given data from two domains (`domain1_train.json` and `domain2_train.json`).

To run the pipeline, please run the files in order:
1. `visualize.ipynb`: This notebook is for EDA and preliminary visualization.
2. `Final_modek.ipynb`: The entire process for implementing SVM model.
3. `cnn.ipynb`: The CNN model with two domains.
4. `word2_rnn.ipynb`: The RNN model using word2vec.
5. "meeting minutes" folder: all the meeting minute documents.
